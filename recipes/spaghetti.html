    <h3 class="sub-title">Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li class="list-element">Gather all ingredients and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li class="list-element">Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
                Cook spaghetti in boiling water until cooked through but firm to the bite,
                 about 8 to 12 minutes. Drain.</li> 
             <li class="list-element">While the pasta is cooking, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat.
                 Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes;
                  drain and discard grease.</li>
            <li class="list-element">Transfer to a bowl and mix in spaghetti sauce.</li>
            <li class="list-element">Place 1/2 of the butter slices into the bottom of a 9x13-inch
                 casserole dish. Spread 1/2 of the spaghetti into the dish.</li>
            <li class="list-element">Mix cottage cheese, cream cheese, and sour cream together in a bowl; spread mixture over spaghetti.</li>
            <li class="list-element">Cover with remaining spaghetti and top with remaining slices of butter.</li>
            <li class="list-element">Pour ground beef mixture over spaghetti and spread in an even layer.</li>
            <li class="list-element">Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes.
                 Spread Cheddar cheese on top and continue baking until cheese has melted and is lightly browned,
                  about 15 minutes more.</li>
            <li class="list-element">Enjoy</li>
